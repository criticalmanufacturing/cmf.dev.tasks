CMF MES HTML Development Tasks
========= 

**@criticalmanufacturing/dev-tasks** is a set of reusable gulp tasks that enable CMF MES developers to jump start their projects by providing state-of-the-art tooling.

This package is meant to be used in conjunction with [html-starter](https://github.com/criticalmanufacturing/html-starter).
